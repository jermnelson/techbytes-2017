In 2016 the State of Library of Colorado started an effort to 
provide a [DP.LA](https://dp.la) service hub for states of Colorado and Wyoming. 
This project uses [BIBCAT][BIBCAT] to transform different formats and 
vocabularies from multiple sources including Denver Public Library's 
RDF [Dublin Core][DC], Colorado College and University of Wyoming [MODS][MODS] metadata, 
and a metadata provided as custom Comma-Separated-Value file from the History Colorado museum 
into BIBFRAME 2.0 entities stored in a triplestore. 

[BIBCAT][BIBCAT] uses RDF-based rules, based upon [RDF Mapping Language][RML] to ingest 
these different types of sources while allowing for easy customization and modification 
through simple editing of RDF turtle MAP file. 

## Build-Measure-Learn (BML) Iteration One

[MODS][MODS] short for *Metadata Object Description Schema* is a Library of
Congress XML metadata format used in many digital repositories, particularly
those repositories based on [Islandora][ISLAND].
